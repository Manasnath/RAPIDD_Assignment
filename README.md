## 📋 Objective  
This project was created as part of the RAPIDD Technologies hiring process.  
It retrieves employee time entries from the given API endpoint, calculates the total hours worked for each employee, and visualizes the results using both an **HTML table** and a **Pie Chart (PNG image)**.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** .NET 8 (compatible with .NET 6)  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `System.Net.Http` → Fetch data from REST API  
  - `System.Text.Json` → Deserialize JSON  
  - `System.Drawing.Common` → Generate Pie Chart (PNG image)  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Fetch Data:**  
   The program calls the RAPIDD API endpoint:
  ' https://rc-vault-fap-live-1.azurewebsites.net/api/gettimeentries?code=vO17RnE8vuzXzPJo5eaLLjXjmRW07law99QTD90zat9FfOQJKKUcgQ== '


3. **Calculate Hours:**  
It calculates the total number of hours worked per employee by subtracting `StarTimeUtc` from `EndTimeUtc`.

4. **Generate HTML Report:**  
- Displays each employee’s name and total hours.  
- Highlights rows in **red** if the employee worked less than 100 hours.

4. **Generate Pie Chart:**  
- Creates `EmployeePieChart.png` showing the percentage of total hours worked per employee.
